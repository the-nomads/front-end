# SWEN 344 | The Nomads Front-end

This is the Front-end half of our SWEN 344 project

## Installation

First you need to install node.js, you can probably figure out how to do that.
Next you need to clone this repo and run ``npm install`` which will setup the environment.

## Running the thing
``http-server`` in the root of the project will start the dev server on ``localhost:8080``, ``ctrl-c`` will stop it.
